## About Project

This is a project based on booking system for a virtual team based community. The first opportunity that we see is futsal where a number of players in team A play a versus match with team B. The basic idea of the software is to create a backend that can support team creation, management, player connections, making challenges for games, uploading scores etc along with a futsal booking system that uses time-slot based bookings.
